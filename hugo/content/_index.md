## Background

Hawaii Dhamma families have been longing for years for the establishment of a Meditation Center.  With this intention, Hawaii Dhamma Families requested Senior Panditarama Nayakas for a Sayadaw to lead the establishment of  Panditarama meditation center and lead the dhamma work,  giving dhamma talk and guiding meditation for Hawaii families.  Hawaii has been very fortunate to have Sayadaw U Tejanana to be sent to Hawaii in June 2016 to provide these Sasana work under Panditarama guidance.  Since then, Sayadaw U Tejanana has been providing weekly dhamma talks and group meditations, weekend retreats, and children dhamma classes. Additionally, we had other Panditarama Nayaka Sayadaws paid visits to Hawaii for special annual retreats and dhamma teachings such as  Pathana, Abhidhamma, and Dhammacakka etc. Hawaii dhamma families continuously provide support with four requisites (Robe, Food, Medicine and Lodging) for Sanghas. 

However,  we have limitations as the center was on a rental property. Hawaii dhamma families have been very keen to have own land and building for Panditarama Center in Hawaii. Together with Sayadaw U Tejanana, dhamma families made great effort in looking for appropriate property. Maha Nayaka Bee Lin Sayadaw and other Nayaka Sayadaws visited Hawaii center and they have provided great encouragement to purchase our own building for the Hawaii Panditarama Meditation Center.
